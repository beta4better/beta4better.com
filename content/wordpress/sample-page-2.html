**Start today. Refine tomorrow.**

If you are waiting for the perfect moment to start or the perfect
product to start with, my bets are that you will keep on waiting for
ever.

Quality is important when there is enough of quantity.

If you have not yet started doing something, start doing it and then
think about making it better.

Think about the quality of your articles only after you start writing.
Before that your concern should be about starting. Think about scaling
your web application after you get enough traffic. Before that think of
ways to get good traffic.

So I rebuild this site using wordpress.
