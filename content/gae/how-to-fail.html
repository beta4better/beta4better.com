This is some words from Seth's Blog, a article about [how to fail][].
After reading that post, you may have a different opinion about fail.

Here are six random ideas that will help you fail better, more often and
with an inevitably positive upside:

</p>

-   Whenever possible, take on specific projects.
-   Make detailed promises about what success looks like and when it
    will occur.
-   Engage others in your projects. If you fail, they should be involved
    and know that they will fail with you.
-   Be really clear about what the true risks are. Ignore the vivid,
    unlikely and ultimately non-fatal risks that take so much of our
    focus away.
-   Concentrate your energy and will on the elements of the project that
    you have influence on, ignore external events that you can't avoid
    or change.
-   When you fail (and you will) be clear about it, call it by name and
    outline specifically what you learned so you won't make the same
    mistake twice. People who blame others for failure will never be
    good at failing, because they've never done it.
