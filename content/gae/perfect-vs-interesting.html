Also some words from Seth's Blog.

</p>

There are two jobs available to most of us:

</p>

You can be the person or the organization that's perfect. The one that
always ships on time, without typos, that delivers flawlessly and dots
every i. You can be the hosting company or the doctor that might be
boring, but is always right.

</p>

Or you can be the person or the organization that's interesting. The
thing about being interesting, making a ruckus, creating remarkable
products and being magnetic is that you only have to be that way once in
a while. No one is expected to be interesting all the time.

</p>

When an interesting person is momentarily not-interesting, I wait
patiently. When a perfect organization, the boring one that's constantly
using its policies to dumb things down, is imperfect, I get annoyed.
Because perfect has to be perfect all the time.

</p>

或许可以换句话说：生于忧患死于安乐，亦或者是人挪死树挪活。
