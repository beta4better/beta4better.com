安裝日誌如下，後續再更新具體的步驟：

	\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
	Downloading https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/archive/stable.tar.gz

	Installing RVM to /Users/beta4better/.rvm/
	    Adding rvm PATH line to /Users/beta4better/.profile /Users/beta4better/.bashrc /Users/beta4better/.zshrc.
	    Adding rvm loading line to /Users/beta4better/.bash_profile /Users/beta4better/.zlogin.
	Installation of RVM in /Users/beta4better/.rvm/ is almost complete:

	  * To start using RVM you need to run `source /Users/beta4better/.rvm/scripts/rvm`
	    in all your open shell windows, in rare cases you need to reopen all shell windows.

	# Charles Yuan,

	#   Thank you for using RVM!
	#   We sincerely hope that RVM helps to make your life easier and more enjoyable!!!

	# ~Wayne, Michal & team.

	  * WARNING: You have '~/.profile' file, you might want to load it,
	    to do that add the following line to '/Users/beta4better/.bash_profile':

	      source ~/.profile
