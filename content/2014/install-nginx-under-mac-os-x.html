安装日志如下，后面再继续更新。

       brew install nginx
       ==> Downloading https://downloads.sf.net/project/machomebrew/Bottles/ngi

       curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
       Error: Failed to download resource "nginx"
       Download failed: https://downloads.sf.net/project/machomebrew/Bottles/ng
       Warning: Bottle installation failed: building from source.
       ==> Downloading http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.6.0.tar.gz
       ########################################################################
       ==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.6.0_1 --with-http_ssl
       ==> make
       ==> make install
       ==> Caveats
       Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

       The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080
       nginx can run without sudo.

       To have launchd start nginx at login:
           ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
       Then to load nginx now:
           launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist
       Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
           nginx
       ==> Summary
       <U+1F37A>  /usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.6.0_1: 7 files, 908K, built in 86 s
